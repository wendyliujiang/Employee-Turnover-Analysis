# Employee-Turnover-Analysis

## Introduction

The Employee Turnover Project is a comprehensive analysis of factors that influence employee turnover, leveraging the power of Python for data processing, analysis, and predictive modeling. Through this project, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can guide HR practices and organizational policies. This repository contains all necessary code, data, and visualizations to understand and replicate our findings.

##Project Steps:
 - Data Cleaning: Processing raw data to remove anomalies, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
- Summary Statistics: Understanding central tendencies, dispersions, and distributions of key variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual and quantitative methods to understand patterns, relationships, and potential anomalies in the dataset.
- Feature Engineering: Creation and transformation of features to enhance the model's predictive power.
- Feature Importance Analysis: Evaluating the significance of each feature in predicting employee turnover.
- Prediction Model: Designing, training, and validating a model for predicting turnover. Special attention has been given to tackle the imbalance in the dataset.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- Python: Primary programming language for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
- Pandas & Numpy: Data manipulation and mathematical computations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization tools for EDA.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for modeling, feature engineering, and predictions.
- Imbalanced-learn: Tackling the imbalance in the dataset.
